  |   platformer, now on Nintendo Switch!                                   |

  |   Take control of Toki Tori, a surprisingly heroic chicken, as he       |
  |   puzzles his way through 80+ levels spread over 5 unique worlds.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Toki Tori isn't very athletic, he can't even jump! Luckily he has     |
  |   some great tools at his disposal, including the Telewarp,             |
  |   Freeze-o-Matic and InstantRock.                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Creative thinking and problem solving are required to collect all     |
  |   eggs in each level, but don't worry! When you get stuck, you can      |
  |   always rewind the time. And if all else fails, use the Wildcard to    |
  |   skip a level.                                                         |
